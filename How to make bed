        <p>The following are the steps of how to make bed:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Clear the bed that is if there is any stuff on the bed take them off and set
                aside.</li>
            <li>Then put the sheet on the bed. If there is any leftover sheet hanging off from the
                end of the bed should be tucked into the bottom of the mattress.</li>
            <li>Replace the old pillow covers with the new pillow covers and put the pillows on the
                bed.</li>
            <li>Then put a comforter on the top the bed sheet.</li>
            <li>Fold the unfitted sheet and comforter on top of each other so that there is a small
                fold at the top of the headrest.</li>
            <li>Now relax in your newly made bed.</li>
        </ol>
